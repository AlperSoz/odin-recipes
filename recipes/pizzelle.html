    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An easy pizzelle recipe for making beautiful Italian cookies on a pizzelle iron. You can flavor the cookie batter with vanilla or anise. These wafer cookies are light and crispy, and they keep well in an airtight tin. Powdered sugar adds an elegant touch to this holiday favorite.</p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs: Eggs lend moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Sweeten things up with white sugar.</li>
        <li>Butter: You'll need a stick of melted butter.</li>
        <li>Vanilla: A tablespoon of vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the pizzelle cookies.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure in the cookie dough.</li>
        <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise slightly.</li>
        <li>Oil: Make sure to brush your pizzelle iron with vegetable oil to keep the cookies from sticking.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the eggs and sugar, then stir in the butter and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and baking powder.</li>
        <li>Spoon the batter onto the prepared pizzelle iron.</li>

    </ol>
